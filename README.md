# DevOps Stage 1: Linux User Creation Bash Script

## Overview
This script, `create_users.sh`, is designed for SysOps engineers to automate the creation of user accounts and groups within a Linux environment. It reads a formatted text file containing usernames and associated groups, sets up user directories with appropriate permissions, generates random passwords, and logs all activities for audit purposes.

## Features
- Reads input from a text file where each line is formatted as `username;groups`.
- Creates users with corresponding personal groups (same name as username).
- Supports multiple groups per user, delimited by commas.
- Generates random passwords securely stored in `/var/secure/user_passwords.csv`.
- Logs all actions to `/var/log/user_management.log`.
- Provides error handling for existing users and ensures clear documentation within the script.

## Technical Article
For a detailed explanation of the script's implementation and rationale behind each step, please refer to the technical article linked [here](#) (to be replaced with your actual link). The article covers:
- Script structure and flow.
- Usage of Linux commands (`useradd`, `groupadd`, `chpasswd`, etc.).
- Handling of input data and error scenarios.
- Security measures for password storage and file permissions.

## Requirements
- **Usage**: `bash create_users.sh <input-file>`
- **Input Format**: Each line in `<input-file>` should be `username;groups`.
- **Outputs**:
  - `/var/log/user_management.log`: Detailed activity log.
  - `/var/secure/user_passwords.csv`: Securely stored passwords.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Successful execution on an Ubuntu machine with the provided input file.
- Correct creation of users and assignment to specified groups.
- Proper logging of all script actions.
- Secure storage and format of generated passwords.

## Submission
- Submit your completed task via the designated form, including a link to your GitHub repository.
- Ensure your repository includes:
  - `README.md` detailing script usage and technical article link.
  - `create_users.sh` in the root directory.
