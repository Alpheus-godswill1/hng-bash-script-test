# DevOps Stage 1: Linux User Creation Bash Script

## Overview
This script, `create_users.sh`, is designed for SysOps engineers to automate the creation of user accounts and groups within a Linux environment. It reads a formatted text file containing usernames and associated groups, sets up user directories with appropriate permissions, generates random passwords, and logs all activities for audit purposes.

## Features
- Reads input from a text file where each line is formatted as `username;groups`.
- Creates users with corresponding personal groups (same name as username).
- Supports multiple groups per user, delimited by commas.
- Generates random passwords securely stored in `/var/secure/user_passwords.csv`.
- Logs all actions to `/var/log/user_management.log`.
- Provides error handling for existing users and ensures clear documentation within the script.

## Technical Article
For a detailed explanation of the script's implementation and rationale behind each step, please refer to the technical article linked [here](#) (to be replaced with your actual link). The article covers:
- Script structure and flow.
- Usage of Linux commands (`useradd`, `groupadd`, `chpasswd`, etc.).
- Handling of input data and error scenarios.
- Security measures for password storage and file permissions.

## Requirements
- **Usage**: `bash create_users.sh <input-file>`
- **Input Format**: Each line in `<input-file>` should be `username;groups`.
- **Outputs**:
  - `/var/log/user_management.log`: Detailed activity log.
  - `/var/secure/user_passwords.csv`: Securely stored passwords.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Successful execution on an Ubuntu machine with the provided input file.
- Correct creation of users and assignment to specified groups.
- Proper logging of all script actions.
- Secure storage and format of generated passwords.

## Submission
- Submit your completed task via the designated form, including a link to your GitHub repository.
- Ensure your repository includes:
  - `README.md` detailing script usage and technical article link.
  - `create_users.sh` in the root directory.

Adjust the technical article link (`#`) with your actual published article link once it's ready. This `README.md` provides a clear overview of your script, its functionality, and the documentation required for submission.

### Prerequisites

Before you proceed with running the `create_users.sh` script, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Linux Environment**:
    - The script is intended to run on a Linux system. Ensure you have access to a Linux environment, such as an Ubuntu machine or a Docker container running a Linux image.

2. **Administrative Privileges**:
    - You need to have administrative (root) privileges on the machine where you will run the script. This is required to create users and groups, and to set file permissions.

3. **Required Commands**:
    - The script relies on several Linux commands that must be installed and accessible in your environment. Ensure the following commands are available:
        - `useradd`: Used to create new user accounts.
        - `chpasswd`: Used to change user passwords.
        - `groupadd`: Used to create new groups.
        - `usermod`: Used to modify user accounts.
        - `getent`: Used to query system databases (e.g., for checking if a group exists).
        - `openssl`: Used to generate secure random passwords.

4. **Input File**:
    - Prepare a text file containing the usernames and groups in the required format. Each line should be formatted as `username;groups` (e.g., `light;sudo,dev,www-data`).

5. **Permissions for Secure Directory**:
    - Ensure that the directory `/var/secure` can be created and that the necessary permissions can be set. This directory will store the generated passwords securely.

6. **Logging Directory**:
    - Ensure that the directory `/var/log` exists and is writable by the script. This is where the activity log will be stored.

7. **Installation of OpenSSL**:
    - OpenSSL is required for generating random passwords. Install it using the package manager of your Linux distribution if it is not already installed:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install openssl
      ```

By ensuring these prerequisites are met, you can smoothly run the `create_users.sh` script and manage user and group creation effectively.
